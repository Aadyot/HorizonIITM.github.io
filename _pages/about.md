<h1 style='text-align:center'>Horizon: The Physics and Astronomy Club</h1>

Horizon, the Physics and Astronomy society of IIT Madras is a registered voluntary student organization, which promotes the learning of physics and astronomy on campus and in the community.  

For most uninitiated freshmen joining IIT Madras, Horizon is one among the ten clubs which are a part of Cф or the Centre for Innovation, the student lab of IIT Madras. However, digging deeper reveals much more than what meets the eye.

The club boasts of organizing numerous talks conducted by professors and student researchers, special viewings of unusual astronomical activities and observation sessions, including off-campus ones – apart from those on-campus – to provide a recluse from the threat of the air and light pollution in the metropolis that is Chennai. All these activities of the club are open to the entire student community which enriches the experience. The club also undertakes student research projects every year, focusing on varied topics in physics and astronomy.

Horizon has diverse academic interests across various disciplines of scientific research, with members having varied levels of experience devoted to pursuing these interests. Many members join the club with little to no prior experience, the only prerequisite being a thirst to learn more about the universe. The club provides them with an opportunity to enjoy the company of other equally enthusiastic students while learning more about the secrets of the cosmos, with one sole purpose in mind – To explore space: the final frontier; to boldly go where no man has gone before!
