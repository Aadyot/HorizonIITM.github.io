These are the projects being undertaken by Club for the year 2020-2021.

## Estimating Age of Star Clusters

Age of a star cluster is directly linked to the type of stars and its stellar evolution history. This project will be a continutation of the work done by spectroscopy and photometry project members last year. The aim is to calculate the age for various open and globular clusters using just the FITS data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey as the input. In the firrst phase, we can develop a first order estimate using known stellar evolution models. once this is done, the members can work on their own stellar evolution models and isochrone relation to fit the data obtained. This will be extended to our own data taken from our telescope. The project can be extended further to multiple clusters and effective fitting algorithms and also ML models.

## A sensitive Cloud Chamber: Particle Detector @ Home

Cloud chamber is an elementary particle detector and it played a prominent role in early particle physics. It was used in the discovery of muons, positrons, kaons, etc. The aim of this project will be to construct a cloud chamber and observe the trails left by particles produced by cosmic rays.

## Dynamics and Chaos in Astronomy

Chaos is prominent in astrodynamics. The aim of the project is to Study the dynamics of planetary systems and solve the dynamics using numerical Simulations. The N-body simulation Python package REBOUND will be used for the Project. We will address several problems such as the stability of Saturn's rings and the Kirkwood gaps

## Cosmic Distance Ladder and Hubble's Parameter Measurement

Few years back we did Hubble constant estimation using Supernovae and CMB data methods. This project will further go down the road by using another method called Tully-Fisher relation to estimate distances to galaxies. We can further combine the results obtained using various methods to figure out the most efficient method. Hubble parameter estimation is a research problem. We still have no clear answer for itâ€™s exact value. This project can be extended further to even Gravitational waves as standard sirens.

## Space Mission Design Tool

With increasing interplanetary missions lately, there is a requirement for space mission design, optimization and navigation. The objective of this project is to develop software which can calculate and simulate trajectories of interplanetary spacecraft missions. Design of maneuvers and transfer orbit optimization will also be embedded in the software. Perturbations of various sorts (perturbations occurring due to solar radiation,Oblateness of planets, asteroid and comet influence) would be considered while designing the software.The preliminary stage of the project will be coded in MATLAB/Python.Prerequisites : Basic Matlab and Python. Project Output till now : https://drive.google.com/file/d/16DJaQLzm0tbPwqg8aCxhU1tFFyErccmD/view?usp=sharing

## Team Aether

The team will work upon building a sounding rocket (it will not be from scratch since previous members have worked upon it a bit), aiming especially for the 2021 edition of Spaceport America cup. We will start working with solid fuel rocket and gradually solving the problem with liquid and hybrid rockets i.e their small scale efficiency, production, storage, navigation etc.
