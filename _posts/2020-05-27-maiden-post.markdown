This is the beginning for the extension of digitial reach of Horizon to all those people who crave to learn (about) the wonders in the world of **Physics** and its sister discipline **Astronomy**, in the language that they view as their own, for it is the language of the *layman*, the language of simplicity, provided by the members of the Physics and Astronomy Club of Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
## Clockwork of the Blog
### Articles
> Physics is a pathway to many tools some consider unnatural.  

The Club will be posting regular articles, of any *scientific*-discipline. Provisions has been made for the readers to post their queries and doubts in the comment section.

### Projects
There is a page which contains the current list of projects being undertaken by the club for the year 2020-2021. The links to the project specific sites are also provided, and the readers are encouraged to go visit them to visually stimulate yourself with the various beautiful animations and plots, for *we do physics just for the beautiful plots*, don't we?

### Gallery
As the name suggests, the page contains the following stuffs:  
1. Astrophotographs
2. Club session photos
3. Illustrations by the club members
4. Some other totally random stuffs, and finally **(drumroll)**
5. Memes
