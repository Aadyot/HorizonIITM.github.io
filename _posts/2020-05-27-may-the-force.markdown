This is a limerick written by David Morin (*of course*), Eric Zaslow, E'beth Haley, John Golden, and Nathan Salwen.
## May the force be with you
>On a merry-go-round in the night,  
Coriolis was shaken with fright.  
Despite how he walked,  
'Twas like he was stalked,  
By some fiend always pushing him right.
