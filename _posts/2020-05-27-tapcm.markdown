*Vanessa*: Dad?  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: Oh, hi, Vanessa!  
*Vanessa*: Dad, what are you doing?  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: Well I'll be honest I don't really understand  
But I fell down this hill and I got glue on my hands  
Now I got records on my fingers  
*Kids*: Whaaaat?  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: Records on my fingers  
I got records on my fingers and I just can't stop  
*Kids*: Don't stop  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: I can't stop I got a platypus   controlling me  
*Kids*: WHAAAAT?  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: I got a platypus controlling me
Now let me sum it up  
It was a strange set of circumstances  
*Kids*: Strange set of circumstances?  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: I fell down the hill, I got glue on my hands now I got records on my fingers  
And I just can't stop  
*Kids*: DON'T STOP DON'T STOP  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: Well I would if I was able  
There's a platypus controlling me he's underneath the table  
*Kids*: There's a platypus controlling himâ€”WHAAAT?  
*Kid*: Oh I get it, platypus is a metaphor for whatever is keeping you down. Like, corporations are a platypus

*Weird Kid*: My teacher is a panda  
*Kids*: Society's a platypus

*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: No just me  
*Kids*: We all got a platypus controlling us  
*Heinz Doofenshmirtz*: I'd stop if I was able  
*Kids*: We all got a platypus controlling us

The platypus controlling me is underneath the table  
Oh wait, no, he's gone!
