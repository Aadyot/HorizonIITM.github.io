## Introduction
 Thunder and lightning bolts were nightmares of early human civilisation till today, 
costing over a __ billion dollars in damage worldwide every year. Some of these 
are combined with other natural disasters like hurricanes and heavy rain to make 
the situation even worse. A single bolt of lightning holds an immense charge of 
over a billion joules of energy on average, which can run a small town for an entire 
day.

 Such powers are some of the biggest green energy sources we have from nature, 
yet hard to extract and store. Such research is being done to make this vision 
come true. But what about until then? It begs the question of how else is this much 
energy dealt with.

It is simple if a strike hits the earth transferring the entire high voltage of the 
clouds onto the earthʼs surface, which is a large neutral body and cannot be charged significantly by a lightening bolt, neutralising the cloud. If it doesn't strike 
the earth, the lightening branches on the sky, piercing the atmosphere ionising the 
oxygen and nitrogen gases till it exhaust its energy (in majority of the cases it 
doesnʼt) or till it reaches a cloud that is oppositely charged.
 When such clouds are not present the strike may find its way towards a 
skyscraper or a sufficiently tall conducting material on a building that travels to the 
ground.

## Preventive Measures
 There had been multiple attempts to protect the structures from lightning strikes 
and one of the most famous form of doing it was through the installation of 
Franklin rod. It is a metal rod mounted on a structure providing a shorter and 
conductive path to the earth through a wire without damaging the structure. It had 
been in use for multiple decades proving to be a reliable method of protection 
against these strikes. Yet, they only provide a conducting low resistance path for 
the lightning and do not prevent them from damaging other structures that donʼt 
have a protection system.

</p>
As an alternative to the Franklin rod, the Early Streamer Emission ESE lightning 
arrester are being used. Here instead of providing a less resistive channel, an 
opposite-charged leader is induced to trap a lightning into a desired channel.

 Such a method is also used through the Rocket and Wire technique, where a 
rocket is fired from the ground with a conductive wire attached, inducing a 
lightning strike completely down to the ground in a straight path.

</p>
Although these methods are more ranged than the Franklin rod, they canʼt be used 
for emergency purposes but are best to avoid a heavy lightning strike expected 
during a storm.

 But even so, The range to completely redirect a storm cannot be done simply by 
rocket and wire nor through the ESE. This demands a high-range lightning 
redirecter.

 This is achieved by the use of virtual lightning rods, formed by the ionised channel 
of a high-energy laser beam.

##  Lightning Redirectors
Lightning strikes reach the oppositely charged cloud or the ground through the 
least resistive path, branching in the sky till it finds one. But similar to the Franklin 
rod and rocket and wire technique, such a least path can be provided. If the range 
of less resistance offered is increased, a higher region of lightning strikes can be 
attracted. Such can be provided if the air is ionised. An ionised air provided a 
lesser density of air and higher conductivity, creating a suction path for the 
lightning strike.

 This path of ionised air can be created if a sufficiently powerful laser beam is 
directed into the sky. Such a feat was attained in a 124-metre tall 
telecommunication tower located on top of the Säntis mountain in north-eastern 
Switzerland. 

The experiment was done in this tower since frequent strikes have to be recorded 
to obtain a good result. This tower is struck by lightning about 100 times a year on 
average and is equipped with multiple sensors to record the lightning current, 
electromagnetic fields at various distances, X-rays and radiation sources from the 
lightning discharges.

</p>
Between 21 July and 30 September 2021, the laser was operated during a 6.3
hour thunderstorm activity occurring within 3 km of the tower. The tower was hit 
by at least 16 lightning flashes, four of
 which, L1, L2, L3 and L4  - occurred during laser activity. The recorded lightning strikes were upward, caused due to a positive cloud and the strike originating 
from the tower to the cloud.

 However, observations at the Säntis Tower over nine years in the absence of a 
laser show 84% negative, 11% positive and 5% bipolar flashes.
 The four recorded laser events were all positive flashes, connecting the top of the
 tower to a positive charge centre in the cloud. This makes it clear that the laser 
was inducing positive flashes more than negative and bipolar ones.

 The lightning strike L2 observed on the 24th of July was recorded in a clear sky 
captured using high-speed cameras. This Strike followed the path of a laser from 
50 metres from the tower. However, the discharge did not completely appear 
straight like that of the rocket and wire technique, where a clear conducting 
material is provided. On the contrary here, while dealing with high voltages and 
ionised air molecules, the current displacement is much more complex for moving 
charges.

 The Santis mountain was also installed with a very high-frequency interferometer 
that observes and locates the Lightning flashes in frames of microseconds. This 
system was used to compare the effectivity of laser beams and Franklinrodsd by 
comparing L1 flash and N07 flash respectively.

In comparison, the beam-influenced flash was more confined to the tower than 
the Franklin rod by 45% reducing the risk of damage to other facilities if it were to 
be installed on other buildings.

##  How was this executed?
 The laser system used in the setup was capable of producing laser pulses with a 
wavelength of 1030nm and 720mJ of energy per pulse. Each pulse has a duration 
of 920 fs at a repetition rate of 1kHz. But while setting up the configuration of the 
laser system, the output energy was reduced to 500mJ with a pulse duration of 
7ps. This was done to prevent any damage to the optics.

 This set-up is established in the Säntis mountain, located in north-eastern 
Switzerland at an altitude of 2,502 metres. On the summit of which stands a 124
m-tall telecommunication tower. The laser system is installed in the radome 
building, cased in an air-tight, air-conditioned and thermally isolated tent, with an 
exit for the laser output directed downwards by a conduit through the
 radome wall to the terrace.

</p>
The laser is reflected by a 4-inch folding mirror into a cope of 7.14 magnification 
ratio. The leakage and perturbation till the telescope is reduced by the use of 
isolated aluminium housing.
 The telescope was composed of an additional folding mirror, a secondary 100 mm 
spherical mirror and a 430-mm diameter off-axis aspheric (elliptic) primary mirror. 
The beam output, which had a diameter of 250 mm, was sent toward the tower tip 
with a vertical angle of 7°. 
Translation stages on the secondary mirror allowed us to focus the beam near the 
tower tip in order to set the onset of the filamentation process in the desired area in which upward lightning is initiated. The focal length of the telescope was set to 
150 m to produce a dense filamentation area of 30 - 50 m above the tower. 
Filamentation is an important part the this process of the ionisation of atmospheric 
gases.

</p>
 During this operation time, the airspace was closed by the traffic authority. 
On 24 July, 2021 the L2 lightning strike was observed with the two high-speed 
cameras: one operating at 24,000 fps, installed on the Kronberg mountain; and the 
second operating at 10,000 fps, installed at Säntis Das Hotel Schwaegalp). 
Note that high-speed camera records of upward positive flashes are very rare and 
there are only a few reported in the literature!
 The velocity estimated from the interferometer data (between  
1* 10^5
 and 
6*10^5 m/s
 ) is consistent with estimates deduced from the camera in Kronberg, 
which yields a velocity decaying from  4*10^5 m/s
 when leaving the tower tip to  9*10^4 m/s
 at the first branching 120 m above it, with an average velocity of 2*10^5 m/s
 over this interval. 
 
Unfortunately, no fast camera image was available under comparable conditions 
(upward positive flash) without the laser during the campaign.
 The filamentation of the laser exerts an electric field in the air. When the electric 
field in the air exceeds the breakdown electric field, the free electrons in the air 
start ionizing other atoms and molecules, giving rise to what is commonly known 
as an electron avalanche. 

A growing avalanche will occur mulate space charge large enough to an create 
electric field higher than the background field, causing a self-propagating 
electrical discharge known as a streamer. 
Streamers can propagate in background electric fields lower than the breakdown 
values. Streamers are cold discharges. During the initiation of a discharge, many 
streamers branch frthe om same stem, causing the current to increase the 
temperature of the stem till thermal ionization sets in, increasing the electron 
density in the stem. 

This increasing density reaches a critical density where a rapid transfer of energy 
transfer to the neutral atoms takes place in the atmosphere, raising the 
conductivity and temperature of nearby gases to thousands of degrees high. This 
conducting channel is the leader, which polarises in the background electric field 
at its tip. The tip creates an electron avalanche creating another leader channel, 
connecting with the downward leader causing a lightning strike that finally tracks 
to the Franklin Rod neutralizing its charge.

##  Conclusion
 Laser-Induced Lighting Technology was a huge success when the lightning strikes 
were redirected and absorbed by the tower during the thunderstorm. This was 
held more effective than the previously used methods of drawing a lightning strike 
and neutralising the clouds.
