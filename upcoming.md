Neutral atomic hydrogen is the dominant component of the interstellar medium in galaxies and the primary fuel for star formation. Understanding galaxy evolution requires understanding the evolution of both the stars and the neutral hydrogen. This talk will focus on an important scientific goal of modern radio telescopes, measuring the atomic hydrogen content of high redshift galaxies, by detecting the 21 cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen. This was the original science driver of both the GMRT and, more recently, the Square Kilometre Array. In this talk, I will trace 30 years of high-redshift 21 cm emission studies, culminating in the recent GMRT detection of 21 cm emission from galaxies during the epoch of galaxy assembly.
