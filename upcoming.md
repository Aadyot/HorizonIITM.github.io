Greetings from Horizon - the Physics and Astronomy club of IIT Madras!

As the new semester has officially begun, we are keen to make some exhilarating announcements. Whether you're a familiar face or a fresh presence on our campus, we're here to provide direction throughout your journey and make you experience Insti at its best.


The Horizon is back with the concatenation of lectures which is ‘Quarks to Quasars.’ This time we are inviting  Prof. Masahide Yamaguchi for the talk. He is presently the Director of the Institute for Basic Science, Daejeon, Korea. 

#### Title: 
Mystery Of The Universe 

#### Abstract: 
Recent developments in theory and observation have revealed much about the universe that was previously the realm of myth and philosophy. The universe is currently expanding, and in the past, it was in a very hot and dense state. Going further back in time, there was a rapid expansion called inflation. On the other hand, it is now known that only about 5% of the energy of the universe is accounted for by the elements we know so well, and the remaining 95% is composed of unknown components. In this talk, I would like to explain what is currently known about the universe and what are the challenges for the future.
