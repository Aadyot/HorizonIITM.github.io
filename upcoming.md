Neutron stars are effectively laboratories in space that allow us to investigate properties of dense matter under extreme conditions, far from the realm of terrestrial nuclear experiments. While multi-wavelength astronomical observations provide us a wealth of data about neutron stars, gravitational waves are allowing us for the first time to probe their interior composition directly, enabling us to understand the nature of nuclear matter.
