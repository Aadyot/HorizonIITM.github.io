Stars with initial (zero-age) masses higher than about 8 solar masses are referred to as 'Massive' or 'Early-type' stars. They have quite alluring life which is sadly much shorter than Sun-like stars. They typically have a quick main sequence phase, a short red supergiant phase, and a spectacular death via a supernova explosion. Before exploding, for a very brief period they go through the Wolf-Rayet phase; widely known as Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Such rare WR stars are supremely hot and possess rapid mass-loss rates. Their supersonic stellar winds carry a large amount of kinetic power and the interaction of winds with the surrounding material leads to form bubble-like structure around them. In numerous scenario, such winds have been proven to produce shocks in which relativstic particles are accelerated emitting nonthermal (NT) emission.

Therefore, after introduction of massive stellar life during this talk; I shall briefly be talking on the first detection of NT emission from a single stellar bubble, G2.4+1.4, associated with a WO-spectral type Wolf-Rayet star, WR 102. Based on the present literature, massive star WR 102 is the hottest star known today with the surface temperature of 200,000 K. The finding from this research constitutes an observational breakthrough and gives new insight on the NT physical processes taking place in the environments of isolated massive stars. In particular, the results show that nonrunaway isolated massive stars are capable of accelerating relativistic particles and are therefore confirmed as sources of Galactic cosmic rays.
