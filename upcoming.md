Our dynamic Universe is adorned by cosmic fireworks: energetic and ephemeral beacons of light that are a million (nova) to a billion (supernova) times brighter than our sun. Fireworks synthesize most elements in our periodic table -- while supernovae synthesize the lighter elements, neutron star mergers synthesize half the elements in the periodic table heavier than iron. I will share with you how we discover cosmic fireworks with robotic telescopes and how we undertake a global, panchromatic follow-up campaign to characterize the astrophysics and astrochemistry. Owing to the nuclear physics of bound-bound opacity, the infrared is the most sensitive probe of the heaviest elements (e.g., Gold, Platinum, Uranium, Neodymium). I will describe a brand new wide-field infrared surveyor, Palomar Gattini-IR, and the next generation WINTER, DREAMS and Cryoscope surveyors. I will also discuss combining information from multiple messengers: light, neutrinos and gravitational waves.
